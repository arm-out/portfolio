It's that time of the year. For some, it’s a time to embark on a journey of self-reinvention—a chance to refine their lives and embrace a fresh start. For others, it’s a moment to bid farewell to past versions of themselves, shedding old burdens and seeking renewal.

I’m not usually one for setting resolutions. I believe more in building sustainable systems rather than chasing specific goals. However, if I were to choose one, it would simply be this: to seek happiness. Not in the sense of avoiding other emotions, but in finding joy in life’s smallest, most ordinary moments.

Negativity seems to surround us—headlines filled with the rise of AI, ongoing wars, persistent racism and discrimination of all kinds, etc. In the midst of it all, I’ve found myself longing for the youthful exuberance I once had, that ability to find delight so easily.

So, this year my resolution is to seek out joy as earnestly as I strive to bring it to others. If anyone is out there reading this I hope this inspires you to do the same.
