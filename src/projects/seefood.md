<br>

seefood was my initial exploration into multimodal AI agents, using the GPT-4 vision API to provide an easy interface to identify food ingredients and suggest calorie and macro breakdowns from suggested portion sizes
<br>

Since this was meant to be an exploration and proof of concept, the API is no longer active due to server function costs
